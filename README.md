# Titanium Mobile Meetup Pack

Thanks for checking out Titanium Mobile!  If you're reading this, you are likely interested in
giving a Titanium Mobile presentation for your company, user group, college class, and/or
sewing circle.  That's great, we're glad to hear it!  Use these materials to bootstrap your 
presentation with enough material for a three hour presentation and lab session.  At the end of
this presentation, your audience will:

- Have a basic understanding of the architecture and APIs of Titanium
- Have their laptop configured for mobile development with Titanium
- Have a real, functioning application that runs on Android and iPhone devices
- Be exposed to all of the support resources and documentation needed to develop independently

## What's inside the Titanium Mobile Meetup Pack

- PowerPoint and Keynote presentation slides to direct your meeting
- Presenter notes for setup, presentation, and lab components
- Source code for starter project and finished product
- Visual assets, badges, and promotional materials for your session for web and print
- Instructions on how to get support from Appcelerator to promote and execute your event

## Who do I contact if I have questions?

If you encounter any errors with this material or have any general questions, 
[please create a support issue](http://support.appcelerator.net) so that we can help you out.
We hope that you can use these materials to have a successful Titanium Mobile lab session.
Have fun, and Code Strong!
