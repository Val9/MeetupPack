# Titanium Mobile Meetup Pack

Thanks for checking out the Titanium Mobile Meetup Pack!  This package contains all the 
source code and presenter materials used for a Titanium tutorial at OSCON 2010 - it ought 
to give you just about everything you need to put on a Titanium Mobile tutorial at your 
company or user group.

## Example Code

In addition to the "Oh Snap!" tutorial, this presentation makes use of the official
[Titanium Mobile Kitchen Sink](http://github.com/appcelerator/KitchenSink) demo application,
so you will want to grab that example as well.  The running example is coded in increments
with public gists associated with each, but the final product and incremental gists are 
located in the `code` directory.

## Presentation Materials

Slides are located in the `slides` directory, and are available in Keynote, PowerPoint, and
HTML format.

Enjoy!
