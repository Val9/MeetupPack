# Preparing to give your Titanium Mobile presentation

Prior to giving your Mobile meetup presentation, you should encourage attendees to:

- Download the latest Android and iPhone development SDKs
- Download the Titanium Developer (appcelerator.com)
- Register for the Appcelerator Network (sign up for access to closed beta)

Access to the Beta will be necessary to create any new projects.  However, students will be able
to import and use existing mobile projects from the Developer even if they do not have the ability
to create those projects.

## Promoting your session

Sign up or log in to Twitter.com and post the following message:

  @appcelerator - I'm hosting a #titanium Mobile meetup on [date] at [place] at [time].

We'll make sure to retweet, and may contact you or take other steps to help you promote your event.
In addition, please check the `assets` directory in the root of the Meetup Pack project for logos,
banners, and other stuff to use on your website or blog.
