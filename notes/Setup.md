# Preparing to give your Titanium Mobile presentation

First and foremost, we encourage you to [go to the App U web page](http://appcelerator.com/community/app-u)
and fill out the form at the bottom of the screen to let us know you're putting on an event.  This gets
you all kinds of free stuff for your event, plus the ability to work with Appcelerator to promote your
event and get some butts in the seats.

## Prerequisites for your event

Prior to giving your Mobile meetup presentation, you should encourage attendees to:

- Download the latest Android and iPhone development SDKs
- Download the Titanium Developer (appcelerator.com)
- Register for the Appcelerator Network (sign up for access to closed beta)

Access to the Titanium Mobile Beta will be necessary to create any new projects.  However, students will be able
to import and use existing mobile projects from the Developer even if they do not have the ability
to create those projects.

## Getting beta program access

If you have a list of attendees that you would like to get accepted into the beta program,
[contact us](http://appcelerator.com/company/contact) and we can try and get everyone accepted prior
to your meeting.

## Promoting your session

Sign up or log in to Twitter.com and post the following message:

  @appcelerator - I'm hosting a #titanium Mobile meetup on [date] at [place] at [time].

We'll make sure to retweet, and may contact you or take other steps to help you promote your event.
In addition, please check the `assets` directory in the root of the Meetup Pack project for logos,
banners, and other stuff to use on your website or blog.

Also, [filling out the form at the App U web page](http://appcelerator.com/community/app-u) will allow
you and Appcelerator to coordinate promotion activities.
