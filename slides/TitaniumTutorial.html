Your local user group Your company To your wife and kids Package includes:  Slides in various formats  Example code  Resources for presenters http://github.com/kwhinnery/MeetupPack Today’s Agenda Titanium Mobile Overview Hello World and Project Walkthrough Building Titanium Apps: Fundamentals Code By Numbers: Oh Snap! Where To Go From Here Questions and Answers Independent Hacking About Me Kevin Whinnery Engineer/Platform Evangelist http://kevinwhinnery.com Twitter: @kevinwhinnery   Web developer by trade and training, lover of JavaScript and open web technologies in general About Appcelerator Open Source Software Company based in Mountain View ~25 employees and growing Developing Titanium for about two years, with Mobile coming in the last year 95% Developers About You New To Mobile Development Mobile Dev Veteran Either way, you’ve come to the right place. Amazing Mobile Platforms Which is great and exciting! ...only how do we target all these cool platforms? Well, you could build native, but... Which platforms do you choose? How many codebases do you want to (or even can you) support? How long will it take to build native on N platforms? How much effort will be duplicated? What if you bet on the wrong platform? Who writes the code?  Hire out?  Retrain/retool yourself or your devs? The Web Is An Option... ...and should be preferred when feasible Mobile browsers are progressing fast and converging around WebKit But there are limitations Native apps are inherently more capable than web apps Native apps run faster and smoother on resource constrained devices Ideally, we build cross-platform native apps... ...but we don’t want to “write once, suck everywhere”* *Loren Brichter, creator “Twitter for iPhone”/Tweetie X-Platform Requirements Target multiple platforms from a single codebase Apps must feel like they belong on the platform Apps need to perform like native Bonus: Open source and extensible Bonus: Use skills we already have Hmmm, I wonder if he has a specific technology in mind... Enter Titanium Titanium is an open source framework for building native mobile (or desktop) applications using open web technologies (JavaScript - optionally HTML and CSS) Titanium Key Facts Open Source (Apache 2.0) Professional Services, SLA Support, Training, and Analytics available from Appcelerator  Titanium Platforms Desktop: Win32, OS X, Linux Mobile: iOS, Android, BlackBerry, webOS (soon) Titanium Projects Titanium Developer (1.2.1) Titanium Mobile SDK (1.3.0) Titanium Desktop SDK (1.0.0) Versioned separately, different release schedules We will focus on Developer and the Mobile SDK Titanium Features Native UI Location APIs Local and Remote Data Social APIs Rich Media APIs Open Source and Extensible Integrated Analytics Development Tools Real native tables, tabs, sliders, and views Native Maps, Compass, and  Geolocation Local SQL Database, Lightweight Key/Value Store, XHR Integrated Facebook Connect and YQL Local and streaming audio and video, media recording Extend Titanium with custom modules in native code Baked-in analytics APIs to measure results and behavior Develop and distribute your app for multiple platforms from a single tool Who Uses Titanium? NBC Universal PayPal MTV Anheuser-Busch Computer Sciences Corporation Intridea (Oil Reporter) 100s of Titanium apps hitting the stores each month (should soon eclipse 1000/month) Titanium Architecture Desktop is HTML focused Can use other scripting languages Mobile: JavaScript interpreted at runtime JavaScript API &gt;&gt; native APIs What Titanium Mobile is not: Not a native wrapper around a web view (PhoneGap being an example of this approach) However, you do have a web view component for HTML/CSS UI if that is your preference Your JavaScript code is invoking native APIs for UI and other native functions Think MacRuby/Hot Cocoa on the desktop or some AAA mobile games which ship with a Lua interpreter Example Example Example Titanium Developer Manage and run Titanium applications Package applications for distribution Run on a device for testing Manage Appcelerator account Demo: Hello World! Creating a mobile project Mobile project structure Editing code, adding UI widgets to the app Deploy to simulator Demo: Kitchen Sink Example Code Living Reference Document Demonstrates API coverage Questions So Far? Titanium as a product Titanium capabilities About Appcelerator Titanium Fundamentals A Titanium application is a JavaScript program that is interpreted at runtime on the device app.js defines the root execution context of the app Note that we are not running in a browser  We use the WebKit KJS JavaScript engine (iOS) or Rhino (Android/BB) Titanium JavaScript API Organized into logical namespaces “Titanium” (or just “Ti” for short) is the root namespace for all Titanium functionality A few other odds and ends in the global space  setTimeout/setInterval  alert  JSON Typical App Composition A single window or stack of windows Tab Group containing many windows Windows contain views Windows and Contexts Windows are the top level container for Titanium applications Applications usually consist of one window or several windows in a tab group Windows usually create new execution contexts Execution context == A unique JavaScript symbol space Such windows are “Heavyweight” windows Can also create “Lightweight” windows (for apps that run in a single context) 3 Demo: Contexts New Project - Two Tabs with “Lightweight” windows Switch to contain urls and contexts Symbols not defined in other contexts The View Hierarchy Views are the building blocks of Titanium UIs  Specialized views: table views, image views, map views, etc. Views can contain child views, which are positioned relative to the parent Layout Options: Absolute, vertical, or horizontal (currently iPhone only) Vertical layouts require height to be set Custom Events Use for cross-context messaging Events are received across all ACTIVE contexts Windows not yet open do not receive events Use also as an inversion of control mechanism  Publish message when the database has been updated  Publish message when contacting a server  Using pub/sub messaging is very useful in a component-oriented framework like Titanium Demo: Custom Events Now lets use custom events in our new app Events can have a data payload Remember that events are only received in active contexts Hey, what about layouts? We’ll demo that later in the tutorial... Cross-Platform Development Not all UI is available across platforms Titanium != “Write Once, Run Everywhere” We try to enable native apps that look and feel like they were created in Objective-C or Java Also note that even cross-platform UI components (like table views) will render differently cross platform Cross Platform testing is critical during dev cycle Cross-Platform Tips iPhone/Android subdirectories Ti.Platform.osname Display height/width OS version Check Out Kitchen Sink Platform example 10 Questions? App Composition Runtime environment UI Layouts “Code By Numbers” Demo App: Oh Snap! Condensed version of Snapost  Source: http://github.com/kwhinnery/Snapost App Features:  Multiple Window/Tabbed UI  Properties API  Camera and Local Photo Gallery  Upload to remote web service (TwitPic) Want to develop and deploy to a device in the space of a few minutes A Nicer Version...
